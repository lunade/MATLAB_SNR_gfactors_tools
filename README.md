# MATLAB_SNR_gfactors_tools
There are tools to calculate SNR maps for 2D and 3D sequences.  The SNR-maps and g-factor maps require the acquisition of GRE images and noise images.  The data should be collected and used as raw data.  To read raw data, there are specific tools for data saved using twix application on Siemens Scanners (Versions VB to VD)
